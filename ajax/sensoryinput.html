      <p class="text-left">Working on <a target="_blank" href="http://mstebbins.com/#cbp=ajax/reardar.html">the Reardar project</a> spawned another internal project; the question was, what is the best way to alert a cyclist to any number of notifications?
      </p>
      <p>For the first portion of the testing, we brainstormed all the practical methods we could think of, built some rough prototypes, and took to the streets of Seattle with brave co-workers to down-select from all the options.

        <p class="text-left">The results of the testing narrowed down what we needed to test to just a couple of concepts per sensory input (audio, visual, and haptic). 
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">The next portion of the testing was to test each sensory input against the rest for the various types of messages we imagined a cyclist might need to notified about, such as "your next turn is a right", "there's someone coming up fast behind you", and "you just received a text message". We chose VR for two reasons; a) to test scenarios that would be dangerous/prohibitely expensive to test in the real world and b) to allow for many more test participants to go through all the scenarios.

      <p class="text-left">Needless to say, it's fun to ride a bike that responds to your pedaling cadence, braking, and handlebar movements in VR. Interfacing the real-world to the virtual world and back took a bit of work, but made for a fantastic test environment. There were a few a favorite notification methods in the end, but I'll save the details for the write-up on our blog (in-work).
