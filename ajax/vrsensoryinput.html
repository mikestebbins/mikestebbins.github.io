    <h1 class="post-title text-left">Structural Optimization</h1>   
      <p class="text-left">I spent several years at Boeing in the 787 Optimization Center, initially as an analyst and then as the lead engineer.  The Optimization Center was tasked with removing weight from the airplane using different methods, including Altair’s OptiStruct FEA-based Optimization software.
      </p>
      <p>The work done was proprietary, so I created the simple videos below to explain the process. FEA-based structural optimization is capable of optimizing for 1000's of different load cases acting on very-complex parts/assemblies...for instance, the types of structure that might join an airplane's wheels to its fuselage ;) Importantly, these methods were shown to be <a href="#" title="" data-rel="tooltip" data-placement="top">almost 4 times more cost-effective</a> than traditional Boeing methods to reduce weight.

        <p class="text-left">This video shows topology optimization on an example part that carries two separate loads. You can watch the software converge on the most efficient arrangement of material needed to carry all loads.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">The next step (not shown) would be to redesign the part in a manufacturable configuration with stiffening members in the same locations as the topology results above show. Then, a size and shape optimization would be run to determine the necessary flange thicknesses, widths, and radii. The final result would be the lightest weight part capable of meeting all specified criteria (strength, stiffness, stability, etc.) under the given loads.

        <p class="text-left">This video shows shape optimization on a cantilevered beam with two separate loads.  The objective was to minimize the beam volume while allowing the beam to displace no more than 3 inches under either load case. The individual "shapes" to be explored in the design space are shown, then the convergence of the software into the final result.</p>

These low-cost printing mediums were developed in the University of Washington's Solheim Additive Manufacturing Laboratory.</p>
