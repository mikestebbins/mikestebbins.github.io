    <h1 class="post-title text-left">Experimenting with Augmented / Virtual / Mixed Reality</h1>   
      <p class="text-left">In 2014, like so many others, I became enamored with the <a target="_blank" href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a> and all of the possibilities that it created for VR. I was interested in using it as a tool in engineering and design as a means to quickly experience concepts without building physical things and to display data too complex for 2-D. 
      </p>
      <p> In my free time, I began building 3D virtual reality scenes in Unity for the Cardboard and also started experimenting with augmented reality using Processing and a webcam. We are increasingly using tools like these for client work, but I can't show anything off (not yet, at least). Instead, see the simple (but fun) Hello World-type demo video below created in Processing (credit to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/augmented-reality-with-processing-tutorial-processing/">Amnon Owed</a> for the tutorial that got me started).
