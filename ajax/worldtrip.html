      <p class="text-left">In 2007, my then girlfriend (now wife) and I took six months to travel through 23 countries in Europe and Southeast Asia. The term 'life-changing' gets thrown around a lot, but travel to parts unknown has a way of yanking you from your comfort zone and exposing you to situations and ways of thinking you'd never experience otherwise. This trip was truly life-changing for both of us and still shapes us today.
