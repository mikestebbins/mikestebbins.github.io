    <h1 class="post-title text-left">3D Printed Bone Tissue Scaffolding</h1>   
      <p class="text-left">In 2011, I designed and fabricated rapid prototyped bone tissue scaffolding for final projects in my Additive Manufacturing and Biomaterials grad school classes. Tissue scaffolding is coated with livings cells from the patient and then inserted into large voids in the bone (due to accidents, disease, etc.), in order for new bone tissue to fill the void. 3D printing of the scaffolding would allow for injury-specific shapes and optimized cell-growth geometry.

        <p class="text-left">Two different layouts were chosen: a triply-periodic gyroid function (GIF below) and a more typical orthogonal structure with 90-degree junctions. As shown in the graphic above (<a target="_blank" href="http://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/files/bertoldi/files/biomaterials2010.pdf">REFERENCE ARTICLE</a>), the compression stress-strain plots show how the gyroid structure creates a more-uniformly distributed stress field. This was important as the 3D printed structures are very delicate in the "green" state (after printing, but prior to any introduction of a stiffening agent in post-processing).</p>

        <p class="text-left">A parametric modeling CAD software (<a target="_blank" href="http://k3dsurf.sourceforge.net/">K3D Surf</a>) was used to generate a solid model of the triply-periodic function, modify parameters tied to pore size and pore density, and then output an STL file to feed to the 3D printer.  </p>

These low-cost printing mediums were developed in the University of Washington's Solheim Additive Manufacturing Laboratory.</p>
